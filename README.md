# krypton
> **_NOTE_** This project uses Tinyjet as the proxy it uses to navigate web pages. I have not made Tinyjet, please go to https://github.com/soap-phia/tinyjet to see more information about Tinyjet!

krypton is a neat little tabbed web proxy that uses Tinyjet (https://github.com/soap-phia/tinyjet) (static version of Scramjet, an experimental web proxy by https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet) that features bookmarking support, tab support, refreshing and more!

In accordance with Siege, the Hack Club YSWS, I made it have a winter themed New Tab page.

> **_NOTE_** This is very much unfinished. There is still no games, apps, or any settings. Apologies.

I hope you like the project! The demo is at: https://krypton-tau.vercel.app/
